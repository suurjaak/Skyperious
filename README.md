Skyperious
==========


Important Notice
----------------

Around 2017, starting from Skype version 8, Skype moved away from its famous
peer-to-peer architecture to a client-server system, and started to store 
conversation history on its own servers only.

Formerly, it used a local SQLite `main.db` database to store chats and messages,
which is what Skyperious was originally created to work with - merging chat 
histories from different computers into one.

Skyperious still works with existing `main.db` files, and can also download
newer messages from Skype online service. But any changes done to the database
no longer affect what is visible in the official Skype program.


---


Skyperious is a Skype chat history tool, written in Python.

You can open Skype SQLite databases and work with their contents:

- search across all messages and contacts
- read chat history in full, see chat statistics and word clouds
- export chats as HTML, text or spreadsheet
- synchronize messages from Skype online service
- view any database table and export their data, fix database corruption
- change, add or delete data in any table
- execute direct SQL queries

and

- synchronize messages in two Skype databases, merging their differences


Additionally, it doubles as a useful database tool for any SQLite file.
Also, a [command line interface](https://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/help.html#commandline)
is available with key functions like exporting, searching, syncing, and merging.
The graphical version includes a Python console window.

Using The Program
-----------------

Skyperious can look through user directories and detect Skype databases
automatically, or you can select specific files or folders.
Once added to the database list, a file can be opened for reading, searching 
and exporting, or compared with another database for merging.

Searching an opened database supports a simple Google-like
[query syntax](https://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/help.html).
You can use keywords to search among specific authors or chats only
(`from:john`, `chat:links`), or from certain dates only
(`date:2012`, `date:2010..2013-06`). Search supports
wildcards, exact phrases, grouping, excluding, and either-or queries.

Skyperious can log into Skype online service and download and save new messages
into the local database file. It can also create a new `main.db` database from
scratch, by downloading all available history.

Skyperious can read chat history archives exported from Skype, and merge their
contents into an existing database, or create a new database from their contents.

(Skype export is available in Skype client v8.5 under
 Settings -> Messaging -> Export chat history from Skype 7.x;
 and in Skype web interface under My account -> Export files and chat history.
 The result is a `.tar` archive containing a `messages.json` file.)

HTML export can download shared photos and embed them in the resulting HTML,
if password for the Skype account has been entered in online-page.
This can be disabled in File -> Advanced Options -> SharedImageAutoDownload.
Image download is also supported in the command-line interface.

In database comparison, you can scan one database for messages not found in
the other, and merge all detected messages to the other database. Or you can
read and copy specific chats and contacts. You can also merge chat history 
archives exported from Skype, via Compare and merge -> 
Select a Skype chat history export archive from your computer.

Skyperious offers a number of options from the
[command line](https://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/help.html#commandline):
```
  export FILE [-t format]    export Skype databases as HTML, text or spreadsheet
  search "query" FILE        search Skype databases for messages or data
  sync FILE                  download new messages from Skype online service
  create FILE [-u user]      create new Skype database, blank or from a Skype source
  merge FILE FILE ...        merge two or more Skype databases into a new database
  diff FILE1 FILE2           compare chat history in two Skype databases
  gui [FILE]                 launch Skyperious graphical program (default option)
  -h [option]                show command line help, for option if specified
```

Skyperious can be minimized to tray, clicking the tray icon opens 
a search popup.

The program itself is stand-alone, can work from any directory, and does not 
need additional installation, Windows installers have been provided for 
convenience. The installed program can be copied to a USB stick and used
elsewhere, same goes for the source code. The command line interface only needs
Python to run.

Skyperious has been tested under Windows 10, Windows 7, Windows Vista,
Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux, and reported to work under OS X and Windows 8.
In source code form, it should run wherever Python and the required 
Python packages are installed.

If running from pip installation, run `skyperious` from the command-line. 
If running from straight source code, launch `skyperious.sh` where shell 
scripts are supported, or launch `skyperious.bat` under Windows, or open 
a terminal and run `python -m skyperious` in Skyperious directory.


Installation
------------

Windows: download and launch the latest setup from
https://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/downloads.html.

Mac/Linux/other: install Python, wxPython, pip, and run
`pip install skyperious`

The pip installation will add the `skyperious` command to path.
For more thorough instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Skyperious has a [Dockerfile](build/Dockerfile), see
[build/README for Docker.md](build/README%20for%20Docker.md).


Source Dependencies
-------------------

If running from source code, Skyperious needs Python 2.7,
and the following 3rd-party Python packages:
* wxPython 4.0+ (https://wxpython.org/)
The following are also listed in `requirements.txt` for pip:
* appdirs (https://pypi.org/project/appdirs)
* beautifulsoup4 (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4)
* ijson (https://pypi.org/project/ijson)
* Pillow (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow)
* pyparsing (https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing)
* SkPy (https://pypi.org/project/SkPy)
* XlsxWriter (https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter)

If wxPython is not available, the command line interface will function
regardless.
If other Python libraries are not available, the program will function 
regardless, only with lesser service - like lacking Excel export or full 
search syntax.

Python 3 is not supported.
