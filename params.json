{"name":"Skyperious","body":"Skyperious is a Skype database viewer and merger.\n\nYou can open local Skype SQLite databases and look at their contents:\n\n- search across all messages and contacts\n- browse chat history and export as HTML, see chat statistics\n- import contacts from a CSV file to your Skype contacts\n- view any database table and export their data\n- change, add or delete data in any table\n- execute direct SQL queries\n\nYou can also compare two Skype databases, scan for differences in chats and \ncontacts, and copy them from one database to another.
