  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    vb.gui = true
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "512"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
